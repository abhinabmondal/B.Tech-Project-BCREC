# 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) developed as part of my Final Year B.Tech Project.
This project was built by a team of 3 members, where I took the role of Team Lead, focusing on design, implementation, and coordination.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a custom Web Application Firewall to provide an additional layer of security for web applications. The WAF is designed to:

🔒 Detect and block SQL Injection attempts

🛑 Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

🚫 Filter out malicious HTTP requests

📊 Provide logging and monitoring features for suspicious activity

⚡ Ensure minimal performance overhead for legitimate traffic
